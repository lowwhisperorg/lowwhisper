          I am a firm believer in the Gospel. 
          I also am happily engaged to my fianc√©e, Riley. 
          I love serving on the worship team at Hendersonville Church. I&apos;m a recent Computer Science graduate from UNCA. In my free time, 
          I love spending time with Riley, going on hikes, and coding.

          This past year, I feel as though God has called me to use my gifts in programming and software development.
          My hope in this endeavor is that God is glorified and it gives me the chance to fellowship with other believers from all backgrounds. 
          Whether you are getting married, 
          starting a company, or planting a church, I would love to be a part of the process.
